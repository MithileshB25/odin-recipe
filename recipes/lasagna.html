    <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>

        <li>6 uncooked lasagna noodles</li>

        <li> 3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            
        <li>Â¼ cup hot water</li>
            
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
            
        <li>1 (26 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water, and set aside. </li>
        <li> Meanwhile, place chicken in a saucepan with enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Cook until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Remove chicken from the saucepan and shred.</li>
        <li>Combine shredded chicken, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, and cream cheese in a large bowl. Dissolve hot water and bouillon in a liquid measure; pour over chicken mixture and stir until well combined. </li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of the spaghetti sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 1/2 of the chicken mixture and top with 3 lasagna noodles; repeat. Top with remaining sauce and sprinkle with remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
